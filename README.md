Online store for Salon

This code creates a virtual salon that fulfills the needs and requirements of the Hair Styling and Aestheticsclass at Maple High School. The client can log in as admin or as employee. There are no passwords set because we were asked not to. When the clients log in as either admin or employee, they will then see menus outlining what they can do.
The admin menu includes making changes to the schedule and inventory as well as accessing the client list and marketing.
The employee menu allows the client to do things that are more specific to each employee such as viewing their own personal schedules, information, logging their hours and viewing their wages for the day.
The code backs everything up to files upon closing the interface so when client logs back in at a later time, their old information such as inventory, client list and employee information will still be saved.
